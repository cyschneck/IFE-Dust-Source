# IFE-Dust-Source
IFEs were first discovered within the Venusian orbit and were believed to be generated by charge dust mass-loading interplanetary magnetic fields. However, the dust source hypothesis for IFEs remains a controversial stance. This program will attempt to correlate IFEs measured near-Earth in the solar wind to small bodies which could be a source of dust using machine learning techniques.

The rotation of the sun twists the magnetic field into an Archimedean spiral given as:

(r - r_0) = -(v/w)($\theta$ - $\theta$_0)

where r = position of spacecraft, r_0 = position of dust source, v = velocity of dust cloud, w = angular speed of sun, $theta$ = angular position of spacecraft, and $theta$sub{0} = angular position of dust source. 

# DUST THEORY
Dust is produced via numerous collisions with asteroids and comets, which gets photoionized rapidly. Charged particles mass-load the incident magnetic field, create a pile-up (increasing |B|). The resulting bend of the magnetic field around the obstacle generates a force that accelerates the dust cloud away from the sun.
