# IFE-Dust-Source

## Overview of Theory
IFEs were first discovered within the Venusian orbit and were believed to be generated by charge dust mass-loading interplanetary magnetic fields. However, the dust source hypothesis for IFEs remains a controversial stance. This program will attempt to correlate IFEs measured near-Earth in the solar wind to small bodies which could be a source of dust using machine learning techniques.

A strong candidate dust source will be a small body that has an orbit inclination close to the XY plane (GSE) of the spacecraft near the time the IFEs were found (small phase difference) for multiple orbits. Because of the large gyroradius of the charged dust, the cloud will travel approximately radially from the source.


## Dust Theory
Dust is produced via numerous collisions with asteroids and comets, which gets photoionized rapidly. Charged particles mass-load the incident magnetic field, create a pile-up (increasing |B|). The resulting bend of the magnetic field around the obstacle generates a force that accelerates the dust cloud away from the sun.
