# IFE-Dust-Source
IFEs were first discovered within the Venusian orbit and were believed to be generated by charge dust mass-loading interplanetary magnetic fields. However, the dust source hypothesis for IFEs remains a controversial stance. This program will attempt to correlate IFEs measured near-Earth in the solar wind to small bodies which could be a source of dust using machine learning techniques.
